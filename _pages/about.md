Hi, I'm Samuel Ramos, a Law student passionate about bridging the fields of Law, Artificial Intelligence, and Technology. Currently, I explore how generative AI can reshape legal education and equip students with critical thinking and problem-solving skills for modern legal challenges. I believe in innovation and creativity as tools for advancing legal practices and education.
