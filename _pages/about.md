Hi, I'm Samuel Ramos. Welcome to my personal Second Brain.

I'm a law student with a deep passion for exploring the dynamic intersection of law, artificial intelligence, and technology. I believe that merging these fields sparks innovation and lays the foundation for a more meaningful future.

Here, I nurture my ideas, document my journey, and reflect on the ever-evolving landscape of technology and its impact on our world. I value transparency, lifelong learning, and the power of community to drive transformative change.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”I look forward to connecting, exchanging ideas, and growing together on this exciting journey.
