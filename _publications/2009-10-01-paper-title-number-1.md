Summary: This paper explores the transformative potential of generative AI in legal education, demonstrating how its integration as a support tool can enhance students' ability to "think like lawyers." By analyzing prior studies, effective techniques, and prompt engineering principles, the paper concludes that generative AI is highly versatile but requires active learning, critical thinking, and proper understanding of its strengths and limitations. Practical guidelines are proposed to balance AI use with foundational learning, equipping students for the complexities of modern legal practice.
