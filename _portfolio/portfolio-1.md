# Description
An AI-powered prompt that applies Rosenshine's evidence-based instructional principles to create interactive learning sessions. Using structured XML prompts and advanced reasoning models (Gemini 2.5), the system breaks topics into small, manageable steps with regular reviews and guided practice, ensuring effective and durable learning. This project is a demostration of how effective prompting can be used for the purpose of learning, using relevant theory (Roshenshine's principle of instructions)

# Tasks 
- Combine with other methods of learning
- Evaluate AI outputs
- Simplify prompt
